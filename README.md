## Project Requirements

### Content
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What aesthetic and technical choices did you make? 
- [x] At least one profile picture
- [x] Biography (at least 100 words)
- [x] Functional Contact Form
- [x] "Projects" section
- [x] Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.
​
### Content Response:
In terms of the overall feel of the website, I wanted an active and playful feel that shows off my creative side. For this reason I wanted to have my animated character play in the water because yes I have a unicorn floatie, yes I love bubbles and damn right I'm playful at heart!  I chose lots of pastels, playful fonts and soft gradients for the colour palette. <br>

I have multiple profiles pictures, including an animated version of me in the header, hero, about me sections and the project section. I includued a real picture on the about me section. <br>

I have a mini bio on the index.html page and a longer bio on the about me page. I included a girl in bubble animation for the about me section as I wanted to keep the theme light. 

The "about me" is in shades of gradient pink which I feel is cute and matches the feel I was looking for. 
Functional contact form - I have a contact form on site and "mailto" link attached to the @ sign in the footer.

Projects section: split into 3 sections - develop, educator and media creator. 

I wanted to showcase how I can bring a lot of skills to the table. I also made a projects page with three example types for each that showcase the depth of my experience. I chose cards because they define different projects easily and are very responsive. 
I figure if each of my skillsets have a different colour, it will be easy to uplaod and categorise my experience which should make it easier for the user to find the examples that are relevant to them.  Links to GitHub, LinkedIn, Codepen and an email link in the footer<br>


### Technical
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What strategies or design decisions did you work from? 
- [x] At least 2 web pages.
- [x] Version controlled with Git
- [x] Deployed on GitHub pages.
- [x] Implements responsive design principles.
- [x] Uses semantic HTML.

### Technical Response: 
Initially tried to do a parallax scroll animation for the hero but it got too difficult to make it responsive. I then started from scratch and made a drop down animation where the girl in the bubble bobs in the water.  
Still incredibly difficult to make responsive but I'm hoping what I'll learn in React and JS will help. 
The hero image took a week alone to make. 

That being said, I am now proficient and now obsessed with CSS animations. I have been using the inspect tool to view the project from every perspective and its very hard to get all of them! Making the cards responsive was far easier because I could use Flexbox and wrap the cards. The other pages had no problems with responsiveness. Next time around I want to have a document viewer for the learner guide and slide deck uploads but am unsure of how they would fit with the design.  <br>

It was version controlled with Git and deployed on GitHub pages. I've spend the most amount of time trying to ensure everything was responsive. The second time I built the page I used the SheCodes template as a base. BIG MISTAKE!!! I have spent more time trying to solve bugs that the older code included in the code then I could have keeping the first site and building that up. Semantic HTML was used throughout. 

### Bonus (optional)
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below, if you included any. 
- [x] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [x] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extra tricky!)
​
### Bonus response: 
I have styles for active, hover and focus states - the primary buttons translate 1 px up and left on hover, and have a glow shadow. On focus, they scale (1.04) and deepen in colour when active with a box shadow. 
The social media icons transform by scale on hover, scale higher again on active and glow with a text shadow on focus. Javascript was included to maek the hamburger menu.  
The big addition here though was animation. I used the animation function from https://webcode.tools/css-generator/keyframe-animation to insert the animations I wanted. The animations are quite complex - the hero has two logo layes on alpha channels that are stuck together. When the logo "hits" the water the top logo fades out and the cut out of the girl without the bubble now floats in the water. A smaller version of the bobbing animation is in the about me section on the index.html page. 

### Screenshots
> Please include the following:
> - The different pages and features of your website on mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes (multiple screenshots per page and screen size).
> - The different features of your site, e.g. if you have hover states, take a screenshot that shows that.  
> 
> You can do this by saving the images in a folder in your repo, and including them in your readme document with the following Markdown code:
